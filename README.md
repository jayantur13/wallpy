# For Fedora/RedHat
sudo rpm -i wallpy.rpm

# For all Linux (portable)
chmod +x Wallpy.AppImage
./Wallpy.AppImage
```

### üìÅ Binary Size Notice

Wallpy uses PyInstaller to bundle all required GTK and Python dependencies into a single standalone binary. This ensures that:

- ‚úÖ Wallpy works out-of-the-box on most Linux systems
- ‚úÖ No need to install Python or GTK manually

> Because of this, the size of each package is ~105 MB (AppImage/.deb/.rpm), and the full release directory is ~350 MB.
>
> > üß™ Advanced users may clone the repo and run Wallpy from source (Python 3.12+ & PyGObject required) to avoid the bundled binary size. See <a href="#-development">Development</a>.

### üí° Usage

1. Launch Wallpy from your Applications menu/Desktop or via terminal:

```
gtk-launch Wallpy
```

2. Select an image directory.
3. Choose an interval and hit "Start".
4. Minimize to tray ‚Äî it keeps running in background.
   > Note: Other than gtk-launch,there are other ways,find them on internet.
   >
   > > App Note:
   > >
   > > - If you rename directory of selected wallpapers,you need to select it again.
   > > - Start on login,only works if wallpaper directory and interval is set.
